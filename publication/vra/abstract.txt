Previous research finds the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) was instrumental in increasing Black political enfranchisement and, consequently, helping Black communities secure more desirable policy outcomes. In this paper, I analyze the broader effects of minority enfranchisement on local public finances by exploiting spatial discontinuities in the application of special provisions of the VRA, generated by a coverage formula defined in Section 4 of the Act. I find that, in response to Section 4 coverage, counties with larger non-white population shares exhibited relative declines in revenues and expenditures, and relative increases in government fragmentation. The findings suggest declines in revenues and expenditures were not mechanical responses to secular changes in the tax base, but were instead likely generated by changing preferences for public goods. This work illustrates how local communities may respond to and potentially undermine efforts to address racial inequality.
